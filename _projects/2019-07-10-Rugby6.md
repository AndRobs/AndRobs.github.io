Can you believe it is week 6 already? Despite this, we're still welcoming new players to the team; tonight was Tom's debut - it's great to have you as part of the team!

Within 6 weeks we've also managed to change coach 3 times. Dan handled preseason before Lauren gave us a new manager bounce leading to our first win and tonight we were in the hands of caretaker manager Jonny!

Four games this week with a long break in the middle was friendlier scheduling than the blockbuster back-to-back fitness session of last week. 

  
# GoodGym Newcastle 1 â€“ 6 The Pablo Escaballs

**Nick**

This game was a glorified warm up for us with the big game coming up next. We still managed a few memorable moments. Jonny probably having the most fun.

> I lied, I lied though the skin of my teeth. I said it was my first ever game so we deserved a few extra yards. 

Evan and Jonny spent time congratulating us post-match for our positioning in this game.

> No one scored against us because we have bad positioning, they were just faster down the wings. The communication is perfect!

Look at all them try scorers! 

This was the big one. There was a strong sense of rivalry, not only were we equally matched in the league, but they also had a GoodGymer in their ranks. I cheekily tried to steal Aimee to play on the GoodGym Newcastle side before the game started but she stayed loyal to Glutton Tag. It's a shame really because I thought she played really well in the half she played, never dropped the ball. 

This was the first time in the tournament that our experience really showed. We were playing quick, before they could get back onside allowing us to break through the ranks. 

> The amount of times we caught the off-guard was unreal!

Nick won't want to be reminded of this but at one point he broke though the defensive line, looking certain to score, before an opposition defender broke the land speed record to catch up! Although, we used our experience again to make sure Nick had teammates with him after the touch to exploit the distance he had gained. 

Scoring 4+ tries also means we get bonus points for high scoring! This is the first time we have officially achieved this; we did put 4 past The Untouchables but this was ruled as only a 3-1 win. Words will be had. 

 
# GoodGym Newcastle 0 â€“ 3 Move Like A Pro

I mean, who even cares. We just won 5-1.


# GoodGym Newcastle 0 â€“ 3 TMPU

Why are we still playing, we won 5-1?

We also had a great photographer today, thanks Jonny!

## MVP

The GoodGym Newcastle MVP for game week 6 is **Tom**! What a first week for Tom! Two tries with basically no preparation. Just showed up and bosh! Talk about a learning curve!

Congratulations!ðŸŽ‰
