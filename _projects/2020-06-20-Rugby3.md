## MVP

The GoodGym Newcastle MVP for this week was award to **Siobhan** for achieving something that no one else on our team managed to do. That is scoring a try in her debut week! Congratulations!ðŸŽ‰


*(Technically, Dan also did this last week but since it's now been ruled out his heroics have been erased from history.)*
