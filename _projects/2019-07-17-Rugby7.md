There were only two games this week which leaves time to look at some stats. Our great performance last week meant we improved our ELO standing from week 5. Newcastle Distilary and Osbit look like they had a great week and massively improved their standing. Another way to intepret this chart is to say we performed the 9th best (relative to our opposition) out of all the teams playing in week 6.

We look to be getting better at scoring tries.

While there is also a slight improvement in our defense.

Finally, we can have a quick look at the distribution of tries for the whole compeition. We can take solace that the most common number of tries to be scored per team per game is 0 tries.
