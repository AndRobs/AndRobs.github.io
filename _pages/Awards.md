The rugby season is almost over and that can only mean one thing - awards!

You will soon be able to vote for who you think deserves an award for each of the categories below. The winners will be unveiled (and collect their award ðŸ‘€) at a get together after the season has finished. This could be after a GoodGym group run at the social, at Kingston Park after our last game of Rugby or on a separate date just for this occasion - which ever people think is most appropriate. 

Voting will open on the 11th of July and run until the 18th of July. Until then, here are the categories you will be voting in. 

## The Creator
The player with an eye for a pass, if you are in space they will find you with an inch perfect ball.
