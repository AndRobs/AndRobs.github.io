We were joined by some first timers tonight in Hannah and Simon, welcome to the team guys! We welcomed the extra legs as some questionable fixture scheduling led to us play all three of our games back to back tonight while our opponents all had a long rest before facing us.

### Tynemouth Beach Touch Rugby Festival

Tonight was the first week of the second half of the tournament. We're entering the *business end* of the seaosn now. It feels like we've only just started and we're already coming towards the end of our rugby careers. It will soon be time to discuss what will happen once the Summer of Touch has ended and the winter rolls in. 
  
However, there is the possibility of one more day of rugby. 

> This year also sees the return of the Beach touch rugby festival at Longsands Beach at Tynemouth on August 3.

This is a one day event, ran by the same people. Who's interested?! *(Hopefully we're not too late to sign up!)*

### Awards Ceremony

That's right. We're planning on a little end of season get together to celebrate our achievements. Nothing is set in stone yet, but we were thinking the first Wednesday night after the tournament finishes which would be the 31st of July. More details will be available once we have more of a plan. 


### Life After Rugby

It'd be a shame for the team we've forged would disapear once the tournament ends. There aren't many tournaments like this, it is just 8 weeks and no commitment to a long season but if you know of anything similar for a different sport you would like to try let us know!
